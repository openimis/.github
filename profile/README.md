openIMIS is an interoperable, versatile open source software which supports the administration of health financing and social protection schemes. It is designed to manage the complex, high-volume data flows which are required to operate such schemes by seamlessly integrating beneficiary, provider and payer data.

Over 13 million people in more than 12 countries benefit from social protection programmes (health insurance, employment injury insurance, cash transfer and voucher schemes) managed using openIMIS.
